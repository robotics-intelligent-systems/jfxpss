# Satellite Communication System Simulation

Scepter provides a framework for Command and Control of one to many spacecraft. This simulator, built on the Bevy engine, offers a realistic simulation of low Earth orbit(LEO) satellites, simulating essential functions such as communication links, computation offloading, and energy consumption. Meep is a free and open-source software package for electromagnetics simulation via the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Xnec2c is an translation to the C language of NEC2, the FORTRAN Numerical Electromagnetics Code commonly used for antenna simulation and analysis. Antenna simulation code using OpenEMS and Octave to optimise a 433MHz band helical antenna design for a LEO cubesat mission. LyceanEM is electromagnetics simulation software. Javelin is a set of ground station tools and utilities for allowing handling of satellite data, satellite control, ground station control, and radio components. GNU Radio is a signal processing runtime and signal processing software development toolkit. The Satellite Constellation Creator has the ability to generate orbital parameters based upon the required number of satellites, planes, and orbital phasing desired, to fully describe the orbits of satellites in an idealised system. High precision satellite orbit simulation and visualization. Orbitdeterminator: Automated satellite orbit determination. Astrodynamics simulation framework. OpenSAND is an user-friendly and efficient tool to emulate satellite communication systems, mainly DVB-RCS - DVB-S2. NASA Operational Simulator for Small Satellites. KubOS is an open-source software stack for satellites. Satellite Network Simulator 3 (SNS-3) is a satellite network extension to Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) platform. The Open Space Toolkit (OSTk) is a collection of versatile libraries for aerospace engineering use. OS3, the Open Source Satellite Simulator, was developed as a framework for simulating various kinds of satellite-based communication, based on OMNeT++
