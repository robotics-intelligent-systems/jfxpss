# Satellite Communication System Simulation

This simulator, built on the Bevy engine, offers a realistic simulation of low Earth orbit(LEO) satellites, simulating essential functions such as communication links, computation offloading, and energy consumption. Meep is a free and open-source software package for electromagnetics simulation via the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Xnec2c is an translation to the C language of NEC2, the FORTRAN Numerical Electromagnetics Code commonly used for antenna simulation and analysis. Antenna simulation code using OpenEMS and Octave to optimise a 433MHz band helical antenna design for a LEO cubesat mission. LyceanEM is electromagnetics simulation software. Ground station tools and utilities for allowing handling of satellite data, satellite control, ground station control and radio components. GNU Radio is a signal processing runtime and signal processing software development toolkit. High precision satellite orbit simulation and visualization. Orbitdeterminator: Automated satellite orbit determination. Astrodynamics simulation framework. OpenSAND is an user-friendly and efficient tool to emulate satellite communication systems, mainly DVB-RCS - DVB-S2. NASA Operational Simulator for Small Satellites. KubOS is an open-source software stack for satellites. Satellite Network Simulator 3 (SNS-3) is a satellite network extension to Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) platform. The Open Space Toolkit (OSTk) is a collection of versatile libraries for aerospace engineering use. OS3, the Open Source Satellite Simulator, was developed as a framework for simulating various kinds of satellite-based communication, based on OMNeT++
